# What is Deepkit Framework?

## Unlocking the Potential of Enterprise TypeScript Development

Deepkit Framework is a cutting-edge, high-performance Node.js framework written entirely in TypeScript. It provides a unified, modular ecosystem that brings together a powerful set of reusable TypeScript libraries seamlessly integrated to accelerate the development of enterprise-scale web applications.

Built for developers seeking to harness the full power of TypeScript on both front-end and back-end, Deepkit Framework enables you to share code such as models, validations, and business logic across your entire stack, creating a truly end-to-end typed environment.

### Why Deepkit Framework Matters

- **Streamlined Full-Stack Development:** Write your front-end and back-end code using one language and type system for a more consistent and efficient workflow.
- **Unified Tools for the Whole Stack:** From HTTP routing to ORM, RPC, validation, and templating, integrated libraries work together perfectly.
- **Enterprise-Grade Performance:** Designed from the ground up with high performance and scalability in mind.
- **Runtime Type Safety:** Real-time validation and serialization powered by TypeScript types ensures fewer errors and rapid development.
- **Modular Architecture:** Use libraries individually or as a combined framework tailored to your specific needs.

### Who Should Use Deepkit Framework?

- Enterprise teams building scalable, type-safe web applications
- Developers looking to unify backend and frontend development with TypeScript
- Teams prioritizing runtime validation, dependency injection, and modular code
- Architects seeking a robust framework optimized for performance and developer productivity

## Introducing Deepkit Framework

### What is Deepkit Framework?

At its core, Deepkit Framework is a Node.js backend framework designed specifically for TypeScript development at scale. Unlike traditional frameworks that might use a loosely typed approach or separate technologies for client and server, Deepkit fully leverages TypeScript’s capabilities to create a robust, real-time application development platform.

It is not just a framework but a collection of standalone reusable libraries unified by a modular framework, empowering developers to build web apps that are fast, maintainable, and reliable.

### The Problem Deepkit Solves

Developers often face challenges such as:

- Fragmented toolchains where front-end and back-end languages or type systems differ
- Redundant code for validation, serialization, and schema definitions across layers
- Poor runtime validation and inconsistent data handling causing bugs and security issues
- Complex boilerplates and slow iteration caused by disconnected technologies

Deepkit Framework addresses these challenges by offering a comprehensive, type-safe environment where your TypeScript code is your single source of truth across API, database, transport, and frontend layers.

### How Deepkit Framework Works

Deepkit Framework organizes your application with a modular architecture, enabling you to compose functionality from dedicated libraries:

- ORM layer for working with relational and NoSQL databases using enterprise patterns
- Runtime type system for validation and serialization driven by TypeScript types
- HTTP routing and API development with automatic parameter deserialization and validation
- Dependency Injection container optimized for TypeScript
- Command Line Interface (CLI) integration
- Remote Procedure Call (RPC) support with WebSocket and TCP transport
- JSX-based high-performance template engine

Everything is designed to integrate naturally, allowing you to focus on delivering business value rather than infrastructure.

## Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Runtime Types & Validation
Deepkit extends TypeScript’s type system into runtime allowing:
- Accurate data validation and serialization matching your TypeScript models
- Use of complex types, generics, unions, and intersections without compromise
- Reduced errors from mismatched data across frontend, backend, and transport layers

### 2. High-Performance ORM
- Support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB
- Enterprise design patterns like Data Mapper, Identity Map, and Unit of Work
- Migration support and relations
- No separate code generation needed

### 3. HTTP Router & Controllers
- Define HTTP routes via TypeScript classes or standalone functions
- Automatic routing parameter parsing and type-safe validation
- Seamless integration with Dependency Injection

### 4. Dependency Injection Container
- Auto-wiring services, listeners, controllers, and commands
- Support for constructor and parameter injection
- Enables clean separation of concerns

### 5. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
- Fast, typesafe bi-directional communication
- Supports WebSocket and TCP transports
- No code generation needed
- Streaming capabilities via RxJS

### 6. Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Define and organize commands with full validation
- Dependency Injection supported in commands too

### 7. Template Engine
- JSX-based templates compiled to optimized JavaScript
- Runtime injection of services
- Asynchronous component support

## Why Should You Care?

### Real-World Advantages
Imagine developing an enterprise application where:
- Your data models are defined once in TypeScript and immediately usable everywhere — frontend, backend, API, and database
- Validation errors are caught instantly before they propagate
- Refactoring type-safe code is faster and less error-prone
- APIs instantly expose full documentation and developers can explore/test them interactively

The result is dramatic savings in development time, improved application quality, and reduced maintenance costs.

### Use Cases

- Large enterprise SaaS platforms requiring strong validation and robust APIs
- Distributed microservice architectures needing fast and typesafe RPC communication
- Teams aiming to share logic seamlessly across the stack
- Developers building real-time applications with complex domain logic

### Before & After Deepkit
| Without Deepkit   | With Deepkit                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Multiple disconnected libraries and typesystems | Unified TypeScript framework with seamless library integration |
| Repeated validation and serialization code    | One source of truth with runtime type safety          |
| Complex integration & boilerplate               | Out-of-the-box HTTP, RPC, CLI, ORM, DI support         |

## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with Deepkit Framework involves:

- Installing the framework using `npm init @deepkit/app my-deepkit-app`
- Defining your first TypeScript-based HTTP or RPC controller
- Using integrated CLI commands
- Exploring built-in runtime types for validation

No complex setup or configuration is required to jumpstart your enterprise-grade application.

For detailed quick start instructions, see [Creating Your First Deepkit App](/getting-started/first-app-setup/creating-your-first-app).

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Define your types once:** Centralize your TypeScript models including validation rules and reuse throughout your full stack.
- **Leverage Dependency Injection:** Architect services and controllers as injectable classes for cleaner code and easier testing.
- **Use RPC for real-time needs:** Benefit from Deepkit’s high-performance RPC when low latency communication is required.
- **Validate early:** Use Deepkit’s runtime types to catch invalid inputs before business logic runs.

### Common Pitfalls

- Overlooking modularity can lead to tightly coupled code; always define clear boundaries using Deepkit’s module system.
- Avoid manually duplicating validation logic outside Deepkit’s runtime types.
