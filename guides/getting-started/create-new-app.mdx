# Creating Your First Deepkit App

Welcome to your journey of building a new Deepkit Framework application. This guide walks you through scaffolding, configuring, and launching a basic Deepkit app from scratch using command-line tools and code examples. By the end, you'll have a live CLI application ready to extend and build upon.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What this guide helps you achieve
This guide equips you to:
- Initialize a new Deepkit project using command-line tooling.
- Create the essential project files and folder structure manually.
- Configure the TypeScript compiler and Deepkit runtime properly.
- Define a simple CLI command.
- Launch and run your Deepkit application.

### Prerequisites
Before following this guide, make sure you have:
- Node.js installed (version 14 or higher recommended).
- npm or yarn for dependency management.
- Basic familiarity with TypeScript and running Node.js scripts.
- A command-line terminal to execute shell commands.

### Expected Outcome
By completing this guide, you will have:
- A new Deepkit app folder with proper configuration.
- `tsconfig.json` configured for decorators and reflection.
- A minimal `app.ts` file defining a workable CLI command.
- The ability to run your app and verify the CLI outputs.

### Time Estimate
This guide should take approximately 15-30 minutes to complete.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner â€” no prior Deepkit knowledge required.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create a new project directory

Start by creating a folder for your application and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-deepkit-app
cd my-deepkit-app
```

### 2. Initialize npm and install dependencies

Initialize an npm project to manage dependencies:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Then install Deepkit App, along with TypeScript and ts-node for development:

```bash
npm install @deepkit/app typescript ts-node @deepkit/type @deepkit/type-compiler
```

### 3. Setup Deepkit TypeScript compiler integration

Deepkit requires its type compiler to enable reflection and decorators necessary for dependency injection and type validation.
Run:

```bash
npx deepkit-type-install
```

This command enhances your installed TypeScript with Deepkit's reflection capabilities.

### 4. Create a `tsconfig.json` configuration file

Your app needs TypeScript configured to enable decorators and reflection metadata.
Create a `tsconfig.json` file with this content:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "target": "es2020",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "reflection": true,
  "files": ["app.ts"]
}
```

<Tip>
The `reflection: true` key enables Deepkit's runtime type reflection, essential for dependency injection.
</Tip>

### 5. Create your main application file `app.ts`

This file is the entry point of your CLI application. Create an `app.ts` file with the following code:

```typescript
import { App } from '@deepkit/app';
import { Logger, ConsoleTransport } from '@deepkit/logger';

// Create a new app instance
const app = new App({
  providers: [{ provide: Logger, useValue: new Logger([new ConsoleTransport()]) }]
});

// Define a simple CLI command named "test"
app.command('test', (logger: Logger) => {
  logger.log('Hello World!');
});

// Run the application
app.run();
```

This example sets up a dependency-injected Logger and a `test` command that logs a greeting.

### 6. Run your Deepkit application

Start your app using `ts-node`:

```bash
npx ts-node app.ts
```

You will see the CLI help structure with the `test` command listed.

To execute your command:

```bash
npx ts-node app.ts test
```

The console will output:

```
Hello World!
```

<Tip>
Make the `app.ts` executable with a shebang and set execution permissions for an even smoother CLI experience.

Add this as the first line of `app.ts`:
```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env ts-node-script
```
Then run:
```bash
chmod +x app.ts
./app.ts test
```
</Tip>

## Understanding Key Files and Concepts

### `tsconfig.json`
Controls how TypeScript compiles your code.
- `experimentalDecorators`: Enables using decorators, required for Deepkit's declarative CLI commands.
- `reflection`: Activates Deepkit's runtime reflection, enabling dependency injection and command argument parsing.

### `app.ts`
Your app's main script:
- Instantiates the `App` class from `@deepkit/app`.
- Registers providers (e.g., Logger) that can be injected into commands.
- Defines CLI commands using `app.command()` or controllers.
- Calls `app.run()` to start command parsing and execution.

### Providers and Dependency Injection
Services like `Logger` are provided through the DI container and injected as parameters into your commands automatically.

### CLI Commands
Commands are functions or methods registered with a unique name. Parameters become CLI arguments or flags with automatic validation.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Use Dependency Injection Wisely**: Inject services like Logger or your own services directly into commands to keep code clean.
- **Name Commands Clearly**: Use descriptive command names with namespaces if needed, e.g., `user:create`.
- **Leverage Decorators or Functions**: Choose class controllers for complex commands or simple functions for quick scripts.
- **Enable Strict Types**: Configure TypeScript with `strict` on to catch early errors.
- **Use npm scripts**: Add convenient npm commands in `package.json` for running your app, e.g.,
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "app": "ts-node app.ts"
  }
  ```
- **Structure Your App**: Keep your commands and services organized in subfolders as your app grows.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Startup Issues">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found or No Commands Listed">
Ensure you have called `app.run()` at the end of your `app.ts` script.
Check that command registration methods like `app.command()` or controllers are properly imported and initialized.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="TypeScript Decorators Not Working">
Verify your `tsconfig.json` has `experimentalDecorators` enabled.
Make sure Deepkit's type compiler is installed with `deepkit-type-install`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Logger Output Not Showing">
Confirm `Logger` provider is defined and injected correctly.
Check console transport setup: `new Logger([new ConsoleTransport()])`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Running app.ts as Executable">
Use `chmod +x app.ts` to enable execution permission.
Check the shebang line is the very first line of the file.
