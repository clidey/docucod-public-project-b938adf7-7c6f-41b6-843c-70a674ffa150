# Performance Optimization Tips

Maximizing the performance of your Deepkit Framework applications—whether general TypeScript-based apps or large-scale enterprise workloads—requires purposeful strategies and settings. This guide focuses on actionable tips and practical best practices specifically to boost both application runtime efficiency and framework-level optimizations.

---

## 1. Why Performance Optimization Matters

In enterprise environments, speed and scalability are essential. Optimizing performance not only ensures fast response times but also reduces server load and operational costs. Deepkit Framework is designed with high performance as a core tenet; understanding and applying its optimization strategies unlocks the full potential of your applications.

## 2. Optimize Template Rendering

### Use Deepkit’s JSX-Based Template Engine Efficiently

Deepkit’s template engine is built for server-side rendering (SSR) with a focus on performance:

- **Safe HTML Handling:** Avoid manual string concatenation. Use the `html()` helper to safely inject raw HTML when necessary without compromising security.
- **Leverage JSX Optimization:** The internal `optimizeJSX` function compiles templates into highly efficient JavaScript, minimizing runtime overhead.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Component Wrappers:** Flatten component trees when possible to reduce extra layers in the virtual DOM rendering.

#### Example: Safe HTML Usage
```typescript
import { html } from '@deepkit/template';

const safeContent = '<strong>Important</strong>';

function MyComponent() {
  // This will render raw HTML safely
  return <div>{html(safeContent)}</div>;
}
```

### Tips
- Use asynchronous function components when fetching data to keep UI responsive.
- Pass dependencies directly to function components to avoid costly container lookups.

---

## 3. Dependency Injection Practices

Efficient dependency management significantly impacts performance:

- **Register Only Needed Providers:** Avoid bloating the DI container with unused services.
- **Scoped Providers:** Use appropriate scopes to control lifecycle and improve garbage collection.
- **Inject Dependencies Explicitly:** Pass dependencies as function or class constructor parameters to leverage auto-wiring and avoid runtime resolution overhead.

---

## 4. Code Compilation and TypeScript Settings

Proper TypeScript and compiler options improve application runtime and developer productivity:

- Set `jsx: "react-jsx"` and `jsxImportSource: "@deepkit/template"` in your `tsconfig.json` for optimized JSX compilation.
- Enable `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata` to support metadata reflection, crucial for DI and runtime type operations.

---

## 5. Query and Data Handling Optimizations

Deepkit ORM and database layers are designed for speed:

- **Select Only Required Fields:** Minimize query payload size by selecting essential columns.
- **Use Efficient Query Patterns:** Leverage ORM methods optimized for batch operations and transactions.
- **Caching Strategies:** Consider integrating caching layers strategically for frequently accessed data.

Refer to [Integrating with Databases](https://docs.deepkit.com/guides/real-time-apis-and-integrations/database-integration) for detailed ORM optimizations.

---

## 6. Benchmarks and Profiling

Use the built-in profiling tools and benchmarks to identify performance bottlenecks:

- Deepkit’s [Profiler Module](https://docs.deepkit.com/overview/introduction-and-value/product-intro) visualizes execution hotspots.
- Monitor database query times and HTTP request handling via integrated charts.

Explore the [Benchmarks Module](https://docs.deepkit.com/website/src/app/benchmarks/benchmarks.module.ts) for real-world performance insights.

---

## 7. Practical Performance Tips

- **Avoid Heavy Computations in Templates:** Keep your templates focused on rendering logic; offload computation to services.
- **Minimize Unnecessary Re-renders:** Structure components to update only when needed.
- **Use Streaming for Large Responses:** When sending large data sets, use streaming responses to improve latency.
- **Asynchronous Components:** Utilize async components to improve throughput and user-perceived performance.

---

## 8. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Direct HTML Injection without Escaping:** Always sanitize or use the `html()` helper to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Excessive DI Container Size:** Large containers slow down resolution; keep your service registrations minimal and relevant.
- **Ignoring TypeScript Config Requirements:** Missing JSX settings or decorators can cause runtime overhead or failure.
- **Unoptimized Template Calls:** Avoid deep nested components without optimization as they increase render time.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Performance Issues

When you notice slow responses or CPU spikes:

<Steps>
<Step title="Profile Your App">
Use Deepkit’s Profiler to identify where time is spent.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Template Render Times">
Analyze templates causing slowdowns using the benchmarks module.
</Step>
<Step title="Review DI Registrations">
Audit your DI providers for unused or heavy services.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Database Queries">
Use query logs and Deepkit ORM Browser to find slow queries.
</Step>
<Step title="Optimize Code Paths">
Refactor hotspots to simpler, more efficient logic or caching.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 10. Summary

Maximize your Deepkit application's performance by leveraging its highly optimized template engine, adhering to best practices for dependency injection, configuring TypeScript appropriately, and profiling your application continuously. Combined with efficient ORM usage and careful component design, these techniques will yield faster, scalable applications ready for enterprise load.
