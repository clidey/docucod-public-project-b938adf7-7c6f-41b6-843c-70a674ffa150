# Where to Get Help

This page provides a comprehensive map of official and community support channels designed to accelerate your troubleshooting, learning, and collaboration with Deepkit Framework users and developers. Whether you’re troubleshooting a tricky error, exploring examples, or seeking direct advice, these resources connect you with the right people and materials efficiently.

---

## Community Support Channels

### Discord

The Deepkit Discord server is the fastest way to get live help and engage with the community:

- **Join the Official Server:** Connect with developers and other users in real-time.
- **How to Ask Questions:** Mention the bot `@deepkit` in any channel to start a new thread focusing on your question.
- **Continuous Interaction:** After the initial reply, keep pinging the bot to refine or extend answers – it supports iterative improvements and edits.

This dynamic interaction model creates ongoing discussions where both beginners and experienced users can contribute, making the Discord server a vibrant hub for support and learning.

[Join Discord](https://discord.gg/PtfVf7B8UU)

### GitHub Discussions

For more asynchronous, documented community Q&A and conversations, the GitHub Discussions area is ideal:

- View and participate in structured threads for common questions, feature requests, and community tips.
- Explore past resolved issues and official announcements.
- Engage with maintainers through issues and feature discussions.

## Official Documentation & Search

Deepkit's documentation includes a powerful integrated search combining:

- **Official Documentation Pages:** Authoritative guides, API references, examples, and conceptual deep-dives.
- **Community Questions & Answers:** Indexed questions answered by the Deepkit Discord bot, enriched with community votes and replies.

Use the global search bar on the docs website to query both sources simultaneously, helping you quickly find relevant content or community-sourced solutions.

*Example:* Entering your error message or feature name presents you with documentation pages and existing community Q&As side-by-side.

---

## Example Projects

Explore curated example projects sourced from the community and official authors to accelerate your learning:

- Each example targets specific categories and usage scenarios.
- Examples are rated by votes and usefulness.
- Access complete code snippets directly within the documentation for easy experimentation.

Reviewing examples relevant to your current challenge is the fastest path from concept to implementation.
