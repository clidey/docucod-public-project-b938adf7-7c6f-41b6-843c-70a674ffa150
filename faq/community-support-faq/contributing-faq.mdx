## Best Practices and Tips

- **Communicate Early:** Discuss significant changes in issues or discussions before implementation.
- **Keep Changes Focused:** One PR per feature or fix promotes easier review.
- **Write Clear Commit Messages:** Explain why the change was made, not just what was done.
- **Stay Updated:** Sync your fork with the main repository frequently to avoid conflicts.
- **Respect the Code of Conduct:** Maintain professionalism and respect in all interactions.

## Troubleshooting Contribution Issues

### Common Problems
- **Build Failures:** Verify correct Node.js version and dependencies.
- **Test Failures:** Review recent changes carefully, ensure all tests pass before PR.
- **Merge Conflicts:** Pull latest changes from main branch into your topic branch.
- **Linter Errors:** Run formatting and lint scripts prior to submission.

<Tip>
Refer to the Troubleshooting Common Issues documentation for detailed guidance.
