# Creating Your First Deepkit App

Welcome to your step-by-step guide to generate and understand your first Deepkit application using the official CLI initializer. This guide walks you through creating the project, exploring the essential files and folders that shape your app’s foundation, and introduces you to the anatomy of the starter application generated by NPM's Deepkit app initializer.

---

## 1. Generate a New Deepkit App Using the CLI

The quickest way to start a new Deepkit app is by running the following command which scaffolds the entire project with the necessary dependencies and starter files:

```bash
npm init @deepkit/app@latest my-deepkit-app
```

This command:

- Creates a new folder named `my-deepkit-app`.
- Sets up an initial project structure.
- Installs dependencies such as `@deepkit/app` and `@deepkit/framework`.
- Creates starter files including a basic `app.ts` entrypoint.

### Next Steps:
```bash
cd my-deepkit-app
npm run app
```
Running this command launches your freshly generated Deepkit app, displaying available CLI commands.

<Tip>
Make sure you have a compatible Node.js and npm environment as defined in [System Requirements](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements).
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the Project Layout

Once generated, your project folder will have a structure similar to this:

```
my-deepkit-app/
├── app.ts
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

### Essential Files Explained:

- **`app.ts`**: The main entry point of your Deepkit CLI application where all commands, controllers, and modules are registered and started.
- **`package.json` & `package-lock.json`**: Define your dependencies and scripts. The `app` script typically runs your CLI app.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Controls TypeScript compiler options. Important here is enabling `experimentalDecorators` and setting `reflection` true for Deepkit to function correctly.
- **`node_modules/`**: Contains all installed dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: Starter documentation with basic run instructions.

<Tip>
The `tsconfig.json` is preconfigured to support Deepkit's runtime types and decorators. It looks like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "target": "es2020",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "reflection": true,
  "files": ["app.ts"]
}
```

</Tip>

## 3. Anatomy of `app.ts` - Your Application’s Heart

The `app.ts` file generated by the initializer sets up a basic Deepkit application using the `App` class from `@deepkit/app`. Here’s what it contains and why it matters:

```typescript
import { App } from '@deepkit/app';

const app = new App();

app.command('hello', () => {
  console.log('Hello Deepkit!');
});

app.run();
```

### What happens here?

1. **Create a New App:** `new App()` builds your CLI app instance, preparing to register commands.
2. **Register Commands:** `.command()` defines a CLI command named `hello` which prints a greeting to the console.
3. **Run the App:** `.run()` starts the CLI application, processes input arguments, and triggers the respective commands.

<Tip>
You can add multiple commands by calling `app.command()` multiple times or switch to class-based CLI controllers for more advanced command structures.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Exploring the Starter CLI Commands

After running `npm run app` or `ts-node app.ts`, you will see an output that lists available commands:

```
USAGE
  $ ts-node app.ts [COMMAND]

COMMANDS
  hello
```

Try running your first CLI command:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node app.ts hello
```

Expected output:

```
Hello Deepkit!
```

This confirms your Deepkit CLI app is working correctly.

## 5. Key Concepts on the Starter App Components

### CLI Commands
- Automatically detected from registered commands or controllers.
- Support arguments and flags typed via TypeScript.
- Can be simple functions or class controllers with an `execute` method.

### Configuration
- Deepkit apps load configuration by default from environment variables and `.env` files.
- Configuration injection in commands and services is supported out of the box.

### Dependency Injection
- Providers can be registered in `App` and will be injected automatically.
- The service container lives behind the scenes, simplifying modular code.

### Extensibility
- You can import Deepkit Framework's `FrameworkModule` and other modules to add HTTP/RPC server capabilities.
- Add your own providers, event listeners, and hooks through the `App` constructor.

---

## 6. What to Do Next?

- **Experiment:** Modify `app.ts` to add new commands.

- **Explore CLI Controllers:** Try switching from simple commands to class controllers for better organization.

- **Add FrameworkModule:** Try importing `FrameworkModule` to enable HTTP and RPC features.

- **Review the Project Structure:** Learn about how to organize a Deepkit app beyond `app.ts`.

- **Check out the full Getting Started Guide:** [Starting and Running Your App](/getting-started/running-and-validation/starting-the-app) covers launching your app and executing commands in more detail.

- **Dive into Configuration Basics:** Understand how you can safely manage environment-specific settings.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<Tip>
If running `npm run app` or `ts-node app.ts` fails:
- Ensure your Node.js and npm versions meet [System Requirements](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements).
- Verify `typescript` and `ts-node` are installed as dev dependencies or globally.
- Check that `experimentalDecorators` and `reflection` are properly enabled in `tsconfig.json`.
- Delete `node_modules/` and run `npm install` again to avoid dependency issues.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If no commands appear:
- Ensure your `app.ts` registers commands before calling `app.run()`.
- Commands should be defined as synchronous or async functions or class methods marked with the proper decorators.
</Tip>

Congratulations! You now have a working Deepkit app scaffold with a clear understanding of its project layout and initial basic application anatomy. Use this solid foundation to innovate and build your Deepkit-powered CLI or web services.
