# Starting and Running Your Deepkit Application

Launching your Deepkit application successfully is a critical first step in making your app live and responsive. This guide walks you through the precise commands, expected outputs, and indicators of a successful start using the Deepkit CLI or direct Node.js invocation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites Before Running

Before you start your application, ensure that:

- You have completed the installation and configuration of your Deepkit Framework app (see Installation and Configuration Basics).
- Your development environment meets [System Requirements](../prerequisites-installation/system-requirements).
- Necessary environment variables or configuration files (e.g., `config.ts` or environment `.env` files) are in place.
- Your project dependencies are installed via your package manager (npm, yarn).

<Tip>
Verify your application builds and compiles correctly before attempting to start it.
</Tip>

## 2. How to Launch Your Deepkit App

Your Deepkit application is launched primarily via the command line interface using `app.run()`, which can be invoked directly through npm scripts or a direct Node.js call.

### Using NPM Script

If your project is set up with a start script in `package.json`, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This script typically calls the Deepkit CLI commands that boot your app server.

### Running Directly with Node.js

You can launch your app via Node.js by running your compiled JavaScript entry point or by using ts-node for TypeScript:

```bash
node dist/server/app.js
# or if working directly with TypeScript source
npx ts-node src/server/app.ts
```

### CLI Command Example

Within your source files (commonly `src/server/app.ts`), starting the app looks like this:

```typescript
import { isMainModule } from '@angular/ssr/node';

const isMain = isMainModule(import.meta.url);
if (isMain) {
  void app.run(); // This starts the Deepkit server process
}
```

This check ensures the app only starts when directly executed.

---

## 3. Typical Console Output on Startup

When the app successfully starts, your console will display messages similar to:

```
[INFO] Angular SSR server bootstrap done, using REQUEST_CONTEXT { serverBaseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080', publicBaseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080' }
[INFO] Deepkit Framework listening at http://localhost:8080
```

You might also see logs about routing initialization, dependency injection setup, and database migration (if enabled).

### What to Look For

- Confirmation that the Angular SSR server is ready (if applicable).
- The framework listening on expected ports (commonly 8080 by default).
- No errors or unhandled exceptions during startup.

<Check>
A successful start means your app is ready to handle requests at the displayed URLs.
</Check>

## 4. Running Your App Locally: Step-by-Step

Follow these steps to get your app running on your local machine.

<Steps>
<Step title="Ensure dependencies are installed">
Run the following to install or verify your dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
</Step>
<Step title="Set up environment variables">
Make sure any required environment variables or `.env` files are in place. For example, if using OpenAI API keys or database configs, ensure these are configured.
</Step>
<Step title="Build your project (if using compilation)">
Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
```bash
npm run build
```
Or use your own build command that outputs to `dist/`.
</Step>
<Step title="Start the application">
Run your app via npm or Node.js:
```bash
npm run start
```
Or
```bash
node dist/server/app.js
```
</Step>
<Step title="Verify the startup logs">
Look for logs indicating the server has started and is listening, as shown above.
</Step>
<Step title="Test your app">
Open your browser and navigate to the server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`) or use curl commands to hit your API endpoints.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### App Does Not Start or Crashes
- **Check environment variables:** Missing or invalid configs often cause failures.
- **Port conflicts:** Ensure no other service occupies your app’s port (commonly 8080).
- **Compile errors:** Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors.
- **Permission issues:** Run with sufficient user permissions.

### Slow Startup or Hanging
- If database connections or external services time out, your app startup may hang. Confirm all external dependencies are reachable.

### Logs Show Errors on SSR Bootstrapping
- Angular SSR integration requires correct setup; verify your `AngularModule` configuration and that `import.meta.url` is correctly used.

<Tip>
Use verbose logging temporarily to get deeper insights:
```bash
DEBUG=deepkit:* npm run start
```
</Tip>

## 6. Next Steps After Starting

- Confirm your HTTP, RPC, or CLI endpoints respond using sample requests (see Quick Validation & Hello World guide).
- Explore further configuration to optimize your startup and server parameters (see Configuration Basics).
- Consult Troubleshooting Common Issues for resolving runtime errors.
